# AdMetricks Test Technical Uf web-scraping
This project was developed with the purpose of demonstrating the technical knowledge acquired during my work experience. To this end, I have developed a API REST in [DRF](), which allows to obtain the value of the daily UF, through the use of scraping techniques from the website of the [central bank]()
